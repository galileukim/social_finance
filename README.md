# social_finance
## intro:

This is a repository for the interview exercise on recidivism rates.

The project is a partnership between Social Finance and the State Department of Corrections.

The research questions guiding our analytical report are:

1. What percentage of individuals released in 2010 were incarcerated again within 1 year, within 2 years, and within 3 years?
2. How do the recidivism rates you originally calculated vary by risk level?

## replication:

This repository has been initiated with [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html). Please run: `renv::restore()` to install all package requirements.

The analysis can be replicated running  `1) data_preprocess.R` and `2) analysis.R`.

Questions can be directed to `responsible@socialfinance.org`.
